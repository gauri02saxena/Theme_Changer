## Description

This Tkinter project, named "Theme Changer", demonstrates a simple yet effective way to toggle between light and dark themes in a GUI application. Utilizing Python's Tkinter library, the project exemplifies how to implement theme switching in a user interface, offering users the choice between different visual modes for enhanced experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Theme Toggling:** Allows users to switch between a light and a dark theme with a simple button click.
- **Customizable Window Settings:** Includes adjustable window title, size, and background color.
- **Visual Feedback:** Uses images to indicate the current theme, providing an intuitive interface.
- **Minimalistic Design:** Focuses on functionality with a clean and straightforward UI.

## Implementation Details

- **Tkinter Library:** Built using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit in Python.
- **Theme Images:** Employs two images (`light.png` and `dark.png`) to symbolize the light and dark themes.
- **Switch Functionality:** Features a toggle function `toggle()` for switching themes, changing the button's image and the window's background color.
- **Button Customization:** The theme switch button is designed with no border (`bd=0`) and a background that adapts to the active theme.

## Usage

1. Launch the Python script to open the GUI window.
2. Click the theme switch button to alternate between light and dark themes.
3. Observe the change in the window's background and the button's image corresponding to the selected theme.
